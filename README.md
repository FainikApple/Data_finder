## Preparation ##
- ***Type in "1" or "2". When ready, press "enter". (This thing won't do anything. It'll only change some forms of words. Mostly noticible in Russian.)***
## Main program ##
- **First** - ***Type in a day. Minimal being "1" and maximal being "31". When ready, press "enter".***
- **Second** - ***Type in a month. (<u>NEEDS TO BE A NUMBER</u>). Minimal being "1" and maximal being "12". Typing in a month that doesnt exist will result in showing "не бывает/doesn't exist". When ready, press "enter".***
- **Third** - ***Type in a year. No boundaries for this one XP . When ready, press "enter".***
- **Fourth** - ***Type in a number of hours. Minimal being "0" and maximal being "23". When ready, press "enter".***
- **Fifth** - ***Type in a number of minutes. Minimal being "0" and maximal being "59". When ready, press "enter".***
- **Sixth** - ***Type in a number of seconds. Minimal being "0" and maximal being "59". When ready, press "enter".***
- **Seventh** - ***The data is now displayed in the cmd. The program has ended.***
## Current easter eggs ##
- **Day == 15, month == 5, year == 2012, hours == 6, minutes == 30, seconds == 0.**
- **Day == 11, month == 9, year == 2001, hours == 9, minutes == 36, seconds == 18.**
